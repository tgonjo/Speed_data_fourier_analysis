# Speed_data_fourier_analysis
This MATLAB programme is designed to analyse absolute and relative frequency components in swimming speed data

1) The data file should be an Excel file with a specific format - each swimmer's data should be contained in each column, with the first row being the ID/name of the swimmer
2) Make sure you know the sampling frequency of the data and the number of stroke cycles contained in the data. The number of stroke cycles should be the same for all swimmers
3) It is highly recommended that you visually check the trend of the speed curve. If any swimmers show a linear/exponential acceleration/deceleration pattern, select option 2 or 3 for the detrending method. If all swimmers show a stable velocity pattern without a linear/exponential velocity change within the data range, option 1 (subtracting the mean) should be sufficient.
